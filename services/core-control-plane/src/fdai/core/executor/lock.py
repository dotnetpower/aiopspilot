"""Per-resource lock manager for the executor.

Multiple concurrent events may target the same resource - a rotate-secret
action and a right-size action on the same Container App, say. Applying
them in parallel would violate the ordering rule in
``architecture.instructions.md § Idempotency, Ordering, and Replay``:

> Events that mutate the same resource are serialized on a per-resource
> key; concurrent actions on one resource are mutually excluded.

Design
------

- One :class:`asyncio.Lock` per ``resource_id``, created lazily.
- This implementation stays in-process and is the local/single-replica
    default behind the ``ResourceLock`` seam. Scale-out composition injects
    ``PostgresAdvisoryResourceLock`` for cross-replica exclusion; the event
    bus resource partition key separately preserves per-resource ordering.
- The manager MUST be safe to reuse across concurrent tasks - the
  per-resource-id dictionary itself is guarded by an internal lock.
- Locks are held for the *duration of the action*; short critical
  sections keep the throughput acceptable.

"""Channel-routing layer.

Implements the routing policy described in
[`docs/roadmap/interfaces/channels-and-notifications.md § 6`]
(../../../../../docs/roadmap/interfaces/channels-and-notifications.md#6-routing-policy-config-driven).

The router:

- looks up a route by ``message.category`` in the matrix,
- preserves ordered failover for A1/A3 and fans A2/A4 out to declared channels,
- refuses to dispatch to a channel whose declared
  :attr:`~fdai.shared.providers.notifications.NotificationChannel.trust_tiers`
  does not include the message's :class:`TrustTier`,
- audits every routing decision (per the safety invariants),
- escalates to the HIL sink when every configured channel fails, so a
  message is never silently dropped.

``core/`` never constructs a channel adapter - the composition root
registers them by kind + id and hands the router a
:class:`ChannelRegistry`. This module holds zero vendor knowledge.

:mod:`.shadow` adds a channel-shaped adapter that renders and durably
records a message without any network call, for a binding still in
:attr:`~fdai.shared.providers.notifications.capability.ChannelMode.SHADOW`.
The router dispatches to it exactly like any other registered channel.

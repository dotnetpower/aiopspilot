"""Fail-closed admission for the deployment-owned six-type operating-intent source.

`ServiceObjective`, `RecoveryObjective`, `CostObjective`, `ArchitectureConstraint`,
`Ownership`, and `ChangeWindow` are the operating-intent ObjectTypes Forseti and the
risk gate read as protected objectives and constraints. Unlike the generic
`FDAI_OPERATING_MODEL_PATH` snapshot (which may legitimately carry only `Resource`
instances), a source presented specifically as the operating-intent binding MUST
supply every required type at its deployment-pinned exact revision and provenance, or
the runtime MUST reject the whole attempt rather than project a partial, duplicated,
expired, or cross-release graph.

Time is handled on two independent axes here. The *effective interval* of an instance
says when its declared intent applies; the *freshness* of the source says how recently
it was actually retrieved. The pinned whole-document digest covers the provenance block
that anchors the second axis, so neither axis can be rewritten without failing the pin.

"""Current-admission gate for deployment-owned operating-intent authority.

Admitting the six-type operating-intent source once, at startup, is not enough. A
source that was complete, pinned, and fresh when the process started can later fall
out of its effective interval, exceed its declared freshness, or disappear from the
deployment mount entirely. The projected graph objects survive that transition - they
are evidence and history - so an authority consumer that reads them directly would
keep granting maintenance authority from a source nothing currently vouches for.

This module is the read side of the bounded revalidation contract. The runtime
revalidation worker durably records what it most recently proved about the source;
every authority consumer resolves that record - status, pinned revision and digest,
rollout generation, owned object identities, and the age of the proof - instead of
trusting a raw graph object.

Three fences make that record safe to read across a rolling deployment.

*Binding* - a reader carries the exact revision and whole-document digest its own
configuration pins, so a record written under any other binding is rejected rather
than accepted just because it parses.

*Generation* - the record carries the rollout generation that wrote it. A reader
rejects a record from any other generation, so an old replica's revalidation pass
cannot authorize a newer rollout, and a newer rollout's record cannot silently
authorize an old replica reading a graph it never validated.

*Ownership* - the record names the intent-source object identities the admission
actually vouches for. A global ``admitted`` verdict therefore cannot bless a
``ChangeWindow`` injected by the generic ``FDAI_OPERATING_MODEL_PATH`` snapshot or by
the continuous operating-model worker, neither of which this pin protects.

Absence is fail-closed for a configured reader: a deleted, corrupted, or
not-yet-written record proves nothing, so it denies. Generic
``FDAI_OPERATING_MODEL_PATH`` compatibility survives only through explicit
configuration - a reader with no expectation is declaring that no deployment-owned
intent binding governs this graph, and it neither grants nor withholds anything of
its own.
